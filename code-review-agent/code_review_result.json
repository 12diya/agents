        "The code lacks comprehensive error handling in several critical areas, especially in model interactions and file operations.",
        "Some modules (e.g., models_custom.py, models_huggingface.py) have debug prints that should be removed or replaced with proper logging.",
        "The file structure handling could be more robust, especially with path manipulations.",
        "The ReviewAgent's prompt template is very rigid and could benefit from more flexibility.",
        "There's no validation for the input parameters in several methods, which could lead to runtime errors."

        "Implement proper logging throughout the codebase instead of using print statements.",
        "Add more comprehensive error handling, especially for external API calls and file operations.",
