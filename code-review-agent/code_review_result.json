        "The code is generally well-structured and follows common Python conventions.",
        "The use of Langchain and Pydantic is appropriate for the task.",
        "Error handling could be improved in some areas, particularly in the `main.py` script.",
        "The `parse_llm_response_to_json` function in `main.py` is a bit complex and could potentially be simplified.",
        "Consider adding more comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.",
        "The `get_file_structure` function could be more robust in handling edge cases.",
        "The code lacks type hints in several places, which can reduce readability and maintainability."
