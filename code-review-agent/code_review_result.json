        "The code is generally well-structured and follows common Python conventions.",
        "The use of `dotenv` and environment variables is good practice for managing sensitive information.",
        "The `load_codebase` function could benefit from more robust error handling, especially when opening and reading files.",
        "The `parse_llm_response_to_json` function includes a regex-based JSON extraction, which is fragile and should be avoided if possible. Rely on proper JSON responses from the LLM.",
        "The `get_file_structure` function could be improved by handling potential errors during file system traversal.",
        "Consider adding type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.",
        "The error handling in `fast_api_server.py` is very generic. Specific exception types should be caught for more targeted error responses.",
        "The `main.py` script has a lot of logic. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.",
        "The code lacks comprehensive unit tests. Adding tests would improve code quality and prevent regressions.",
        "The `WrappedBedrockModel` class prints the prompt and response to the console, which is not ideal for production environments. Use logging instead."

        "Replace the regex-based JSON extraction in `parse_llm_response_to_json` with a more reliable method.",
        "Use a logging framework instead of printing to the console in `WrappedBedrockModel`.",
